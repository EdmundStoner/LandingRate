# LandingRate
X-Plane 11/12 Landing rate plugin

This is version 1.84 (2023-02-28) of the LandingRate FlyWithLua script, originally written by Dan Berry.

Added VR support by William R Good (SparkerInVR) based on initial work by Erhardma

I added a gear force Indicator and worked on making the G's Indicator a bit more accurate
