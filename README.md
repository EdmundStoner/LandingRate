# LandingRateMx Alpha

## This is a work in progress!

X-Plane 11/12 Landing rate plugin that I have modified to analyze the forces that Xplane datarefs provide while landing the craft

This is version 1 (2023-02-28) of my LandingRateMx, FlyWithLua script, originally written by Dan Berry with added VR support by William R Good (SparkerInVR) based on initial work by Erhardma

I currently use a function to record and display the max G's that occur during a landing.
