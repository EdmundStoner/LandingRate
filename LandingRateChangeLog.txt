    -- after the aircraft is below 15M AGL 
        the Gforce dataref reading will be captured every frame until 
        xplane has determined that a wheel hit the ground
        Gforce was previously the average of last 30 readings, mostly < 1G,
        and the greater your descent, the lower your G's
        Changed to read the maximum Gforce reading of the last 10 readings
    -- Added an indicator of force on the gear using the xplane datarefs for
        downward and rearward gear newtons converter to Lbs/Ft
    -- Developed the G's on the gear by dividing the force on the gear 
        by the weight of the aircraft
