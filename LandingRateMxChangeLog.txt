Change on 2023-03-03
    -- took out error checking, never saw a difference of less than 1 millionth of a g
    -- added a gforce average after any wheel touches until the instance that all wheels touch
    
    
Change on 2023-03-02
    -- Added some error checking
    -- Reworked some logging data G errors will show both dataref and pre display values
    -- Added border color 
    -- changed the table classes to allow creation of data to csv strings for debugging
    -- created CattIIIB height variable to easily control resets for a new landing record (currently 15M)
    -- fixed the recording of nose slams, bounces and re-landing
    
Change on 2023-03-01
    -- Cleaned up the code and reworked the comments

Change on 2023-02-26
    -- used the gear forces divided by the weight to generate the reading of G's
    -- added after landing readings to make sure that each bounce is analyzed

Change from original on 2023-2-25 
    -- after the aircraft is below 15M AGL 
        the Gforce dataref reading will be captured every frame until 
        xplane has determined that a wheel hit the ground
        Gforce was previously the average of last 30 readings, mostly < 1G,
        and the greater your descent, the lower your G's
        Changed to read the maximum Gforce reading of the last 10 readings
    -- Added an indicator of lb force on the gear using the xplane datarefs for
        downward gear newtons converter to lbf, defined as the gravitational 
        force exerted on a mass of one pound under the condition of standard gravity (9.80665 m/s2).
    -- Developed the G's on the gear by dividing the force on the gear 
        by the weight of the aircraft
